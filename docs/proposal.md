## Summary of the Project
The goal of our project is to train an AI agent to climb as many floors as possible in an obstacle tower by solving puzzles to find the exit to move to the next floor. The agent will have to recognize symbols and objects, such as keys to solve puzzles and locked doors. It will receive images frames by observing its environment to identify symbols and objects. The agent will output a movement action. It can choose to move in the four directions, turn left and right, or jump to navigate through the levels.

## AI/ML Algorithms
We will train the agent using PPO with a convolutional neural network for object detection.
